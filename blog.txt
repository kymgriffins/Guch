The Sustainable Development Agenda.
17 Goals for People, for Planet
The Sustainable Development Goals are a universal call to action to end poverty, protect the planet and improve the lives and prospects of everyone, everywhere. The 17 Goals were adopted by all UN Member States in 2015, as part of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development which set out a 15-year plan to achieve the Goals.
Today, progress is being made in many places, but, overall, action to meet the Goals is not yet advancing at the speed or scale required. 2020 needs to usher in a decade of ambitious action to deliver the Goals by 2030.
A Decade of Action
With just under ten years left to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals, world leaders at the SDG Summit in September 2019 called for a Decade of Action and delivery for sustainable development, and pledged to mobilize financing, enhance national implementation and strengthen institutions to achieve the Goals by the target date of 2030, leaving no one behind.
The UN Secretary-General called on all sectors of society to mobilize for a decade of action on three levels: global action to secure greater leadership, more resources and smarter solutions for the Sustainable Development Goals; local action embedding the needed transitions in the policies, budgets, institutions and regulatory frameworks of governments, cities and local authorities; and people action, including by youth, civil society, the media, the private sector, unions, academia and other stakeholders, to generate an unstoppable movement pushing for the required transformations.
Numerous civil society leaders and organizations have also called for a ‚Äúsuper year of activism‚Äù to accelerate progress on the Sustainable Development Goals, urging world leaders to redouble efforts to reach the people furthest behind, support local action and innovation, strengthen data systems and institutions, rebalance the relationship between people and nature, and unlock more financing for sustainable development.
At the core of the 2020-2030 decade is the need for action to tackle growing poverty, empower women and girls, and address the climate emergency.
More people around the world are living better lives compared to just a decade ago. More people have access to better healthcare, decent work, and education than ever before. But inequalities and climate change are threatening to undo the gains. Investment in inclusive and sustainable economies can unleash significant opportunities for shared prosperity. And the political, technological and financial solutions are within reach. But much greater leadership and rapid, unprecedented changes are needed to align these levers of change with sustainable development objectives. #ForPeopleForPlanet

COVID-19 response
Developing countries are most at risk during ‚Äì and in the aftermath ‚Äì of the pandemic, not only as a health crisis but as a devastating social and economic crisis over the months and years to come. According to UNDP income losses are expected to exceed $220 billion in developing countries, and an estimated 55 per cent of the global population have no access to social protection. These losses will reverberate across societies; impacting education, human rights and, in the most severe cases, basic food security and nutrition.
To support the poorest and most vulnerable, the UN has issued a Framework for the immediate socio-economic response to COVID-19, calling for an extraordinary scale-up of international support and political commitment to ensure that people everywhere have access to essential services and social protection.
The UN COVID-19 Response and Recovery Fund aims to specifically support low- and middle-income countries as well as vulnerable groups who are disproportionately bearing the socio-economic impacts of the pandemic. Women leaders convened by UN Deputy Secretary-General Amina Mohammed have called for support for the UN roadmap for social and economic recovery and for fully funding of the UN Response and Recovery Fund.
COVID-19 Is More Than a Health Crisis.


COVID-19 response
The World Food Programme‚Äôs food assistance programme provides a critical lifeline to 87 million vulnerable people across the world. Their analysis of the economic and food security implications of the pandemic outlines the potential impact of COVID-19 on the world‚Äôs poorest people. 
In light of the pandemic‚Äôs  effects on the food and agricultural sector, prompt measures are needed to ensure that food supply chains are kept alive to mitigate the risk of large shocks that have a considerable impact on everybody, especially on the poor and the most vulnerable.  
In order to address these risks, the Food and Agriculture Organization urges countries to:
Meet the immediate food needs of their vulnerable populations, 
Boost social protection programmes, 
Keep global food trade going, 
Keep the domestic supply chain gears moving, and 
Support smallholder farmers‚Äô ability to increase food production.
The UN‚Äôs Global Humanitarian Response Plan lays out steps to fight the virus in the world‚Äôs poorest countries and address the needs of the most vulnerable people, including those facing food insecurity.



Today, 19 August 2020, marks the 11th World Humanitarian Day. This occasion is an opportunity to pay tribute to humanitarians who have committed their lives to bringing help to vulnerable people in crisis and conflict situations.
"To really change the world, we have to help people change the way they see things. Global betterment is a mental process, not one that requires huge sums of money or a high level of authority. Change has to be psychological. So if you want to see real change, stay persistent in educating humanity on how similar we all are than different. Don't only strive to be the change you want to see in the world, but also help all those around you see the world through commonalities of the heart so that they would want to change with you. This is how humanity will evolve to become better. This is how you can change the world. The language of the heart is mankind's main common language".- Hon Guracha, Rise Up and Salute the Sun: The Writings of Hon Guracha.








By modifying current practices much can be done in terms of improving the productivity of many food and agricultural production systems. Productivity will need to continue to increase in the future to ensure sufficient supply of food and other agricultural products. However, this must be done while limiting the expansion of agricultural land as well as safeguarding and enhancing the environment. This is the core of the transformation necessary for sustainability in food and agriculture systems. Efficiency in productivity has, in the past, been mostly expressed in terms of yield (kg per hectare of production) but future productivity increase should consider more dimensions. Water and energy-smart production systems will become increasingly important as water scarcity increases and as agriculture will need to seek ways to reduce emission of greenhouse gas. This will also have an effect on the use of fertilizers and other agricultural inputs..

The African Union has committed to ‚ÄúSilencing the Guns‚Äù in Africa by 2020, yet today, millions of people on the continent still face the scourge of conflict, displacement and violence. A large portion of those affected are young people who have their livelihoods destroyed and their futures snatched away. 
Given the urgency of achieving an Africa that is at peace with itself and in honour of International Day of Peace on the 21st of September 2020, the International Association for Political Science Students (IAPSS) Africa regional chapter will be hosting its first UN75 Dialogue on Youth, Peace and Development in Africa to consolidate and elevate the views of young people in Africa on building a better UN that can help deliver the future we want.
