							<h2>The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).</h2>
							<p> The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), also known as the Global Goals, were adopted
								by all United Nations Member States in 2015 as a universal call to action to end
								poverty, protect the planet and ensure that all people enjoy peace and prosperity by
								2030. The 17 SDGs are integrated—that is, they recognize that action in one area will
								affect outcomes in others, and that development must balance social, economic and
								environmental sustainability. Through the pledge to Leave No One Behind, countries have
								committed to fast-track progress for those furthest behind first. That is why the SDGs
								are designed to bring the world to several life-changing ‘zeros’, including zero
								poverty, hunger, AIDS and discrimination against women and girls. Everyone is needed to
								reach these ambitious targets. The creativity, knowhow, technology and financial
								resources from all of society is necessary to achieve the SDGs in every context. </p>
